# Indirect-InferenceARMAest
Purpose of the code: Estimate the parameters of an ARMA(p,q) time series model using the simulation based method
Indirect Inference, see e.g. Indirect Inference - C. Gourieroux, A. Monfort and E. Renault (1993). The auxiliary model is an AR(p) model.
The code, written in Ox, is a solution to the summer course exam in Advanced programming in quantitative economics 
in 2014 at Aarhus University.
A requirement to run the code is the package Maxsa for Simulated Annealing maximization. It can be dowloaded at http://personal.vu.nl/c.s.bos/software.html. The file estarma_example.ox contains an example.
